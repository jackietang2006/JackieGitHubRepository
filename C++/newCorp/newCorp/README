1. go to src/; make clean & make
2. set env variable - NetFlowDataDir to data/
3. su to root to change UDP socket RCV BUF size as following -
    sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=524288
    sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=524288
4. To run NetFlow Collector:  go to bin/; run nfCollect and then nfGenerator
5. To run NetFlow RelayAgent: go to log/; run nfRelayAgent and then nfGenerator
6. To monitor the progress of both Collector and RelayAgent -
    run nfMonitor and follow the usage instructions: Use 1111 for Collector and 2222 for RelayAgent

Note:
   1. I test the RelayAgent between VM and my host PC, it is pretty good.
   2. I did not test the mutiple reporting sources, but the code should support it.
